## Who I am?
Hello, my name is kresna A.K.A kubiku, I'm a muslim tech entusiast.
## My motivation to share my thought
The inspiration behind creating this blog comes from a powerful quote in the movie _V for Vendetta_:  
_"Beneath this mask, there is more than flesh. Beneath this mask, there is an idea, and ideas are bulletproof."_  
This resonates deeply with me, as I believe ideas have the power to inspire and create meaningful change. By sharing my thoughts, I hope to spread knowledge and beliefs that others might find useful.

Additionally, I draw motivation from a profound teaching in Islam:  
_"Convey from me even if it is just one verse"_ (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari).

With this, I aim to share not just technology-related content but also values and reflections that could inspire or help others in their lives.

Feel free to explore, engage, and share your thoughts here! Letâ€™s exchange ideas and grow together.

May Allah Guide All Of Us
